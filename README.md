AIM:

To design a Full Subtractor circuit and verify its truth table in Quartus using Verilog programming.

Equipments Required:

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

Software – Quartus prime

Full Subtractor

A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction involving three bits, namely minuend, subtrahend, and borrow-in . It accepts three inputs: minuend, subtrahend and a borrow bit and it produces two outputs: difference and borrow.
 
Diff = A ⊕ B ⊕ Bin

Borrow out = A'Bin + A'B + BBin

Truthtable
